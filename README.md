# Root HTTP Proxy

This is a proxy that lets you access your desired location through the root of the domain (hence, root proxy). To change the destination, see instructions below.

To install and run, this is as simple as it can ever get:
```
npm install
node index.js
# Access through localhost:8080
```
To change the port:
```
PORT=8888 node index.js
```
The settings are accessible through /quickpanel `localhost:8080/quickpanel`

The theme really sucks since I did this in a rush, so if you would mind improving on it, make a pull request.

Have fun!<br>
